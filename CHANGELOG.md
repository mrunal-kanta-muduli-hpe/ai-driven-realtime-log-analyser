## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Highlights

This is the first production release of the AI Driven Realtime Log Analyser, featuring:

🚀 **Real-time Capabilities**: Live dashboard with WebSocket communication
🤖 **AI/ML Intelligence**: Machine learning-powered analysis
📊 **Rich Visualizations**: Interactive and static chart generation
🏗️ **Enterprise Ready**: Production-grade architecture and configuration

The system successfully demonstrates automated log analysis with real-time monitoring capabilities, achieving the primary goal of intelligent log processing with immediate visualization updates.

### Migration Guide

This is the initial release, so no migration is required. For new installations:

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run demo: `./demo.sh`
3. Start real-time dashboard: `python main.py --realtime-dashboard --port 8889`

### Known Issues

- WebSocket connection may require specific port availability (8890)
- Large log files (>10MB) may require configuration tuning
- Browser compatibility tested on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Support

For issues and questions:
- Run with debug flag: `python main.py --debug`
- Check configuration: `configuration/default.yaml`
- Review logs for error details
